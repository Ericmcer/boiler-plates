## Synopsis

A solid boilerplate that can be dropped in to any new application to get front and backend up and running quickly. 

## Features

After setting this up you will have a modern webserver that is extensible and efficient. The only routes included are the authorization routes. The only pre-built front-end stuff is a blank homepage and a React authorization app that handles signup/login. Building out the homepage and styling the auth page will result in a quick and easy boilerplate for a web app.
